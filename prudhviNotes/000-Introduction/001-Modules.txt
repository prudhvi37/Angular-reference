TypeScript Modules...

We can export any function or class or an interface from any ts file.

The exported functions or classes or interfaces can be used in other modules by importing them.

Eg:

in exporting ts file export.example.ts

export class MyClass {}

to import the class in other ts file

import { MyClass } from 'export.example';

These modules needs to be processed to get js code by using commonjs or system.js or any other.

Then we get javascript code, but we cannot use that code inside any html document using script tag.

We need to use any module loader.

The default loader for Angular is Webpack.
