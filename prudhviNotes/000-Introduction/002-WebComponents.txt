Web Components are custom html elements created by a developer or a company.

eg:

<custom-table rows=5 columns=5><custom-table>

Instead of using several div tags, table elements for creating a table, we can create a custom html element similar to the above.

The same code can be reused by different applications, if we develop it to be re usable.

We can think Web Components idea similar to Object Oriented Programming.

One programmer or a company can create one web component, and can distribute them as per their wish. That is free or paid.

Programmers can create General Purpose web components for different requirements.

Companies can create web components which offers an easy interface with their applications, such as Amazon to easily use their AWS features.

Web Components have the following core concepts

1.	Custom HTML elements
2.	HTML templates
3.	Shadow DOM


1.	Custom HTML elements

•	May contain letters, digits, dots, hyphens, and underscores
•	Can't contain uppercase letters
•	Can't conflict with existing elements or CSS properties
•	Must contain at least one hyphen

eg: <my-component></my-component>

2.	HTML templates

The HTML, that has to be rendered when the my-component element is used.

3.	Shadow DOM

The HTML that is rendered through a web component is independent from its parent.

i.e. If parent DOM has a style that shows all H1 elements in blue color, and if there is any H1 inside an web component, it need not to be blue.

The html elements that comes from a web component, are not accessable from parent DOM tree. Only the web element is accessable from the parent DOM tree.
