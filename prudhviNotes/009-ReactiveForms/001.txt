Though we can achieve most of the form related requirements through template driven forms, sometimes it may not be sufficient.

Angular offers another forms module known as Reactive Forms Module.

In template driven forms, angular creates form group and we access its properties and value in our component. In Reactive forms, we have to create everything, thus we can 
have more control over the form.

To use Reactive forms, first we need to import its corresponding module from @angular/forms and add it to the imports array of app root module.

import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

then add it to imports array

imports: [
    ...,
    ReactiveFormsModule,
    ...
  ]
