By using form builder method to create form, we can set initial values for the form controls in three different ways.

1.

this.myForm = this.fb.group({
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe'
      })

2.

this.myForm = this.fb.group({
        firstName: {value: 'John', disabled: false} ,
        lastName: {value: 'Doe', disabled: true}
      })

Note that, here, we must use both value and disabled and assign values to them, we cannot use only one.

3.

this.myForm = this.fb.group({
        firstName: ['John'] ,
        lastName: [{value: 'Doe', disabled: true}]
      })

Here, in this method, we only passed first value in the array. We can pass more values in this method for validations, which we will see later.
