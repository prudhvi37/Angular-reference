Another way to build forms using angular reactive forms is by using FormBuilder.

To build a form using FormBuilder, we need to import it first inside the component and start using it

import { FormGroup, FormBuilder } from '@angular/forms';

Then inside the class

    myForm: FormGroup;
    
    constructor(public fb: FormBuilder) {
      this.myForm = this.fb.group({
        firstName: '',
        lastName: ''
      })
    }

After this, we can use myForm exactly the same way, as we used when we created using FormGroup.

setValue, patchValue are also applicable.
