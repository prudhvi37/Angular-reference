After attaching form group and form control names to the input properties, we can validate, get value from the form and its controls in the following ways...

get values from the form using

myForm.value

check if the form is valid by using

myForm.valid

To access the individual form controls, we can get them by using either

myForm.controls.firstName.value
myForm.controls.firstName.valid...

or

myForm.get('firstName').valud
myForm.get('firstName').value


All other properties dirty, pristine etc., are also available on both form and form controls.
