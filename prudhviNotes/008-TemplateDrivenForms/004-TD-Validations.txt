When angular creates form object, it adds following properties to the input elements of the form and the form itself. Based on these we can validate the form.

To each input element and form, the following properties will be available

ng-valid  - True if the element is valid
ng-invalid - True if the element is invalid

ng-touched - True if the user entered into the form element atleast once
ng-untouched - True if the user didn't enter into the input element

ng-pristine - True if the value of the input element is not changed
ng-dirty - True if the value of the input element is changed


All of the above properies are available on the form itself, based on which we can check the validity of overall form.
