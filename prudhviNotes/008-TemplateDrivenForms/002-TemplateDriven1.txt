Template Driven forms are easy to implement.

To make any form in an web page controlled by Angular, first add a local reference variable to the form element and give it the value ngForm.

<form #myForm="ngForm">
...
</form>

Then angular takes control over the form, creates a form model with several properties to access the values from the form and to perform several validations.

To make any input field inside the form attached to the form model created by Angular, add ngModel and give the element a name.

<input type="text" ngModel name='username'>

To establish a two way binding between an input element and a component property, add ngModel inside [()] and assign it to the components property.

<input type="text" [(ngModel)]='propertyName' name='username'>

To pass the form details to component add (ngSubmit) to the form element and associate with a method inside the component.

<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(myForm)" #myForm="ngForm">
...
</form>

Then, when the user clicks on the submit button, the form details will be sent to the onSubmit method as an object.
