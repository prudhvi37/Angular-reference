Forms are one of the very important part of many web applications. Angular 2 have an entire module dedicated to forms which we need to import in app.module.ts file.

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

then add FormsModule to the imports array.

We can implement forms in two different ways in Angular, Template Driven and Model Driven.
