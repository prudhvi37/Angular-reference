In angular 2, we can bind the values of HTML attributes to the values of the component.

[property] syntax is used for property binding.

Property Bindings are one way bindings, that is, the data from the component flows to the view.

Eg:

in component class

isDisabled=true;

in HTML

<button [disabled]='isDisabled' >Submit</button>

<h1 innerText={{title}}></h1>

The above code makes the button disabled in the view, if we change the value of isDisabled to false in component, then the button will be enabled.
In the above code, we hardcoded the value of isDisabled, but in real time scenarios, the information may depend on several external factors, which dynamically changes its value.
