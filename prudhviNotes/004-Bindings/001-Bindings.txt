Static html is ok, as long as we want to show only static content to the user. But that makes our application a pretty old static html website.

In dynamic applications, data comes from various sources and we also need to react to the actions that happen in the view, such as user click on a button. We will see them in bindings.

Bindings is the way of linking component values and the view.

In AngularJS everything was two way binding. A link between view and controller was always there. If the number of links becomes more, it affects the performance of the application.

In Angular 2, we have both one way and two way bindings.

In one way binding, data flows either from component to the view or from view to the component.

In two way bindings, a link between the view and component will be established. Angular suggests to use less number of two way bindings.
