After creating temporary view variables, we can pass them to the component through event binding.

<h2 #val>
  Second Heading
</h2>

<input type="text" #myInput >


<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" (click)='passValue(val)' >Pass Value</button>
here we are passing h2 element, to get the value in the component, we need to access its .innerText property


<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" (click)='passInputValue(myInput)' >Pass Value</button>
for Input variables, innerText is not available, so we need to get input value by using .value property.
