In Angular to render the values from the component into html, we use {{}} syntax, which renders the property values from components into strings.

Inside appcomponent class, we can give a value to a property

title = "App works",

to display the value of title property in html, we have to use

{{title}}

We use this syntax at several places in anguar, inside html elements and also as values to attributes like the following...

<img src={{imgSrc}} alt="">
and inside the class imgSrc="http://example.com/myimage.jpg";

Like following...

<p>Answer is {{20 + 30 }} </p> (in the view Answer is 50 will be displayed)

can also perform certain calculations based on values from the component

<p>Answer is {{20 + 30 - compValue() }} </p>

here inside component class 

compValue() {
    return 25;
  }
