In Event Bindings, data flow from view to the component.

We can bind an element in the view to any event, and can perform certain action in the component when that event occurs.

(event name)='action to perform()' is the syntax used for event binding.

Eg:

<button (click)='clickEvent()'>Click Me </button>  , where clickEvent() is a method inside component class.

clickEvent() {
    console.log('Perform Something Here');
}

The function triggers, when user enters something in the input field, will be executed for each letter.

<input type="text" (input)='inputEvent()' >

inputEvent() {
    console.log('User Started Typing');
}

This function will be triggered, when user copy some/full part of the text

<h4 (copy)='copyEvent()' > some information</h4>

copyEvent() {
    console.log('User Copied Something');
}
