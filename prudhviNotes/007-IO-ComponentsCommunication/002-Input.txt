A child component can receive some value from its parent. To do so we need to do

inside child component, decorate a property which needs to receive a value from parent with Input() 

@Input() propertyName;

Then in parent components html, we need to pass the value through child component selector

<child-app [propertyName]='valueFromParent'></child-app>
