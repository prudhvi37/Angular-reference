Apart from sending some properties values from parent component to child component, sometimes, we may want to pass/project some html content also. 
We can do this by adding the html content that we want to pass to the child component, inside the child component selector and adding ng-content element inside the child component.

Eg:

The html content we want to pass to the child component inside

<h1>From Parent Component</h1>

So first we need to put the above html inside child component selector.

<child-app>
    <h1>From Parent Component</h1>
</child-app>


Then to retrieve the value sent by the parent, add ng-content inside child component html.

....
<ng-content></ng-content>
....



Apart from plain html, we can also pass parent component property values through content projection.

<child-app>
    <h1>From Parent Component {{parentProperty}} </h1>
</child-app>
