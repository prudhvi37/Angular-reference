Parent component can access properties and methods of child component by using ViewChild.

To use ViewChild, we need to first import the child component in Parent component and assign it to a parent component property with ViewChild decorator.

@ViewChild(ChildComponent) parentProperty;

then inside parent component we can access all properties and methods of child component using parentProperty.

parentProperty.childProperty;
parentProperty.childMethod();

Note that the ViewChild works only when we add child component selector inside parent component html.
