To load a component containing welcome message in the home page and to display a component containing 404 error message when nothing matches in the route,
 we can configure our routes as following

RouterModule.forRoot([
      { path:'', component: WelcomeComponent },
      { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent }
    ])

now inside the root component (normally app component), we have to provide an outlet, where the routes load.

inside app component..

<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

Note that, in angular routes, Order of routes matters, that is, if we give { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent } first in the array, then it matches to every path, 
so we always get 404 error message.
