Sometimes, we may have to navigate from one place to another, based on any user action.

Suppose, when the user click on logout button, we may have to take them to the home page of the application.

To do that, we need to import Router inside the component, and navigate to another route using its navigate method.

In template...

<button (click)='logout()' >Logout</button>

In the component,

import {Router} from '@angular/router';

then inside the class

constructor(public router: Router) {

    }

    logout() {
        this.router.navigate(['']);
    }
