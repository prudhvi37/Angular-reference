We can often have much deeper links in our application, to handle them we have to declare our routes appropriately

{path: 'user/:id/edit', component: UserComponent}

the above declaration handles urls such as user/123/edit

Note that, here id need not be only a number, it can be a combination of string and number such as

user/abc123/edit
