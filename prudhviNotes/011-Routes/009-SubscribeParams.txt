The snapshot method of ActivatedRoute, only provides the initial value of the id from the url.

If the url changes dynamically, then we may have to access the changed value by subscribing to ActivatedRoute parameters.

to do so, inside the component, we need to do 

this.route.params.subscribe((params) => {
            let id = params.id;
            console.log(id);
        })
