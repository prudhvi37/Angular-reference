In most applications, we may not have all static pages, and we may have to render some content based on a value in the url, such as user id.

We can pass values from the template to the component

<a  [routerLink]="['/user/3/']"> User </a>
<a  [routerLink]="['/user', 3]"> Edit </a>
<a  routerLink="/user/3/"> Edit2 </a>

All above types are valid and results in sitename/user/3/ url.

In the above example we hardcoded 3 in the link, but the value can come from the component also

<a  [routerLink]="['/user', userId]"> Edit </a>

where userId is a value coming from the component.

To handle the above format, we need to declare our route as following

{path: 'user/:id', component: UserComponent}

With the above declaration, now id holds the value.

Then to access these params in the component, we need to first import the ActivatedRoute from angular router module, then inject it through constructor, then use as below

import {ActivatedRoute} from '@angular/router';

constructor(public route: ActivatedRoute) {        
    }

let id = this.route.snapshot.params['id'];
