Angular provides routes as an external module and we need to import it and add it in dependencies to use it in an application.

import {RouterModule} from '@angular/router';

Then add it to imports array...

we can add RouterModule in two ways, one for root and one for child.

We should add for root to the root module of an application, and for child for any feature modules.

RouterModule.forRoot([])

Inside the array, we specify the route configurations.
