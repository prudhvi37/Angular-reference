One more advantage of using Reactive forms is, we can listen to the value changes property of the form, and we can take certain task, based on the changes.

To listen to the value changes, we need to subscribe to that property.

To subscribe to entire form value changes...

this.myForm.valueChanges.subscribe(value => {
        console.log(value);
      });

To listen to a specific form control value changes

this.myForm.controls.email.valueChanges.subscribe((value) => {
        console.log(value);
      })
