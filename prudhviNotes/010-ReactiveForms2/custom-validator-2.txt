The error message we return from the validator function if the input value is Invalid, will be received by its control (rating in our case)

In our example, when the input value is valid and if we access

myForm.controls.rating.errors 

its value will be null.

If the input value is Invalid (that is above 5 or below 1) its value will be

{valid: false} (which we returned from the validator function).

We can use these things to show any error message to the user like below.

<div *ngIf='myForm.controls.rating.errors && myForm.controls.rating.dirty ' >Please enter a value in between 1 and 5</div>
