We can nest one form group in another form group like below

 this.subGroup = this.fb.group({
      city: ''
    })
    this.myForm = this.fb.group({
      name: ['', Validators.required],
      address: this.subGroup
    });

with the above form, if we console log subGroup, we can get myForm as its parent and root.

note that, if we do like below

this.myForm = this.fb.group({
      name: ['', Validators.required],
      address: this.fb.group({
        city: ''
      })
    });

then, we get parent as undefined.
