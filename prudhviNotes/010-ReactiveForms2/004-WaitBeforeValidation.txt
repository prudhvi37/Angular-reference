Now with our validations, the error message appears as soon as the user start typing in any form control.

That is, as soon as user start typing in email form control, the error message appears that invalid email until he enters in proper format.

Sometimes, we may have to allow the user to enter and then validate the value, when he stops entering.

For such scenarios, we can use the debounceTime of reactive operator.

So, now we can modify our code to validate email in the following way

First import from rxjs

import 'rxjs/add/operator/debounceTime';

then add it to subscription

this.myForm.controls.email.valueChanges.debounceTime(1000).subscribe((value) => {
        console.log(value);
        if(this.myForm.controls.email.invalid === true) {
          this.invalidEmail = true;
        } else {
          this.invalidEmail = false;
        }
      })

with the above code, now we wait for user to pause for 1000ms, then we validate the value from the form control.
