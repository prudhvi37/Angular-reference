Inside component

myNum = 123.845841234;

in html

{{myNum | number}}

the result will be

123.846

By default angular limits the decimal points to 3 digits. Also note that after 5 in the original number we have 8. So angular transformed it to 123.846 instead of 123.845.

{{myNum | number:'5.2'}}

the result will be

00,123.846

The first option 5 tells what are the minimum number of digits to show on lhs of the decimal point. The next number 2 tells the minimum number of digits on rhs of the decimal point.
Here though we mentioned 2, as default value 3 is greater than 2, angular is showing 3 digits. To limit maximum number of decimal points we have to provide additional parameter.

{{myNum | number:'1.1-1'}}

now the result will be

123.8

Here again though we mention 1 for lhs, as it is for minimum number of digits, angular shows all digits.
