Date pipe takes input in either as a number (milliseconds since UTC epoch), or an ISO string (eg: Sun Jan 01 2017 09:44:12 GMT+0530)


inside component

cTime = Date.now()

in template:

{{cTime}}<br>
{{cTime| date}} <br>
{{cTime| date:'short'}} <br>
{{cTime| date:'medium'}} <br>

the output should be similar to depending on the time of execution of the application.

1494251513046
May 8, 2017 // default without any params
5/8/2017, 7:21 PM // with short as param
May 8, 2017, 7:21:53 PM // with medium as param

other acceptable params are

shortDate
mediumDate
longDate
fullDate
shortTime
mediumTime

For custom date format, we need to provide info as yyddMM type format

eg:

{{cTime| date:'dd-MMM-yy'}} 

the result will be

08-May-17
