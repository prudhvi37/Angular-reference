If we want to add two structural directives to one html element in the following way

<div *ngIf='true' *ngFor='let user of users' >
  {{user.id}}
</div>

we get the following error.

Can't have multiple template bindings on one element.

To solve this issue, we need to add one more wrapper element

<div *ngIf='true'>
  <div *ngFor='let user of users' >
    {{user.id}}
  </div>
</div>


While the above way solve our issue, it will add another div element to the DOM.

If we want to avoid this, we can use ng-container, which makes the code

<ng-container *ngIf='true'>
  <div *ngFor='let user of users' >
    {{user.id}}
  </div>
</ng-container>
