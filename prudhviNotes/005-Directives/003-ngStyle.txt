NgStyle attribute directive modifies the appearance of an element on which it is placed. We can also modify the appearance based on the values from component and can change
the appearance by reacting to certain events.

inside html...

<div [ngStyle]="{'color': myColor, 'font-size':fontSize + 'px' }" > Sample Text </div>

<input [(ngModel)]="myColor" />
<button (click)='increaseSize()' >+</button>

inside component...

 myColor = 'blue';
  
  fontSize = 24;
  increaseSize() {
      this.fontSize = this.fontSize + 1;
  }

  Here, we are setting the color and size of the div element inside the component. These values can be dynamic, and can vary based on certain conditions.

If we change the value in the input field, it will be changed automatically and similarly we can increase the size by pressing + button.
