ngFor is angular's for statement, that adds as many DOM elements in the view which is equal to the length of the array.


in component

myStrings = ["One", "Two", "Three"]

in the view

<div *ngFor="let string of myStrings" > {{string}} </div>

With the above statement, angular iterates through the array and creates 3 div elements, each with the value from the array, like..

One 
Two 
Three 

To get the index of the array, we can add one more statement to ngFor statement.

<div *ngFor="let string of myStrings; let i = index" > {{string}} : {{i}} </div>, then it produces the following view

One : 0
Two : 1
Three : 2
