An Angular 2 application contains atleast one Angular Module and one component.

Angular 2 application can also have services and depend on external angular modules such as forms, routes, http etc., or custom modules.

Angular 2 root module contains the information about all components, services, and other modules that are used inside the application.

A very basic Angular 2 application containts atleast one Root Module and one Root Component.

An Angular 2 application comes with few built in directives and pipes which we can use inside the application. If we want to create our own directives or pipes, 
we can create them, 
then we have to inform Angular 2 application about the custom directives or pipes through Angular Module.
