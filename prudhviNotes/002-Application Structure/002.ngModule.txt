In declarations array, we have to enter all the components that are used inside the application.

In imports array, we have to enter all external modules, our application needs. 

In providers array, we need to enter all the services that our application need.

Then Angular takes all the provided information, keep it ready and bootstraps root component, in our case app component.

Example:

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    HeaderComponent,
    SidebarComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule
  ],
  providers: [UserService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
