Components are the building blocks of an Angular application.

Components are responsible for the view. Whatever we want to show to user through view, must come from a component.

An angular application must contain atleast one component which is root component.

Based on the requirements of our application, we can create as many components as we want, such as header component, body component, sidebar component, footer component etc.,

To create a component, we have to create a class first and decorate it with @Component decorator.

A component is always associated with a View Template, a class that defines and handles the content in the view and some meta data that we have to provide through decorator.
