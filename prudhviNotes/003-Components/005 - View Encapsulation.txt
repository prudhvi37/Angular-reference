By default the styles defined in the global styles will propagate to all components.

That is, if we define any style inside main index.html file, all those styles will be applied to all components.

Then, if we define any styles for any particular component, those styles will override the global styles.

If we define any style in one component, and if that component have another component in its html, the styles defined in the parent component won't propagate to the child component.

If we want to modify this behaviour of any component, we need to provide an additional parameter to component declaration syntax - encapsulation.
 (we also need to import ViewEncapsulation from angular core).

encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated  (this is default behaviour)


To check this behaviour - Add the following css to global styles.css file

h1 {
    color: olive;
}

Then this value will be applied to all h1 elements in the application (as long as we do not have any other h1 defined locally for any component).

The styles defined in the component will not go propagate to the global styles.
